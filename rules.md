# X-Team 80 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Discuss with the group based on skillset. Reassign if difficulties arise.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Commit history via github, email/group chat.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Designated group chat.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Reminders through the group chat, trying to complete tasks early. Monitor the commit history.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Respond in a timely manner to chat messages.
