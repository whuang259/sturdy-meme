# X-Team 80 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will discuss tasks together as a group and assign them based on strengths and weaknesses of individual team members. Personal preferences will be taken into account when assigning. We will reassign as necessary if significant difficulties arise and another memebr is willing to swap tasks (probably done after a group chat discussion). 


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Progress can be tracked with the github commit history to make sure everyone is doing work. We will check in periodically through the group chat one everyone's task.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will create a group chat (probably text or slack) with every team member. Team members can help each other if difficulties arise in the group chat.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will issue periodic reminders in the group chat of incoming deadlines and emphasize early completion to avoid late work. We will monitor the commit history to ensure that sufficient progress is made to meet deadlines.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
To avoid missing important announcements, all team members should view the group chat on a regular basis and respond in a timely manner to questions.
